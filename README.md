# la-cucaracha
An open source project focused on generating an archive of folk music for cultures that lack said archives.

We're not sold on "la cucaracha" yet.

There's a long and winding road ahead of us, but like the Blues Brothers said, "We're on a mission from God..."

We're starting with Mexico, and our verification system will be tailored to Mexican law. Everyone can input the lyrics of a popular folk song they know. Our entries are to be divided by several confirmation layers:
1. We know nothing about this song and cannot say whether or not it is of public domain
2. We know it's not registered at "Indautor" (the mexican instute where songs are registered) but still aren't sure this song is of public domain
3. We know this song isn't public domain. This is the author. If we have enough information to tell you when this song will become of public domain, we'll do so.
4. We know this song isn't registered and we've published it for a while on our platform or elsewhere (that we know of). We think this song might actually be of public domain, but can't say for sure.
5. This song is of public domain.


We hope government institutions and universities collaborate with our efforts to build up a decent reliable index of mexican folk.
If you believe your culture could benefit from an effort like this one, please reach out so we can work out how to help you build your verification layers according to the laws of your country.
